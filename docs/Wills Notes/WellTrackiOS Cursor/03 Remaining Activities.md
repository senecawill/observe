I apologize for the confusion. You're right. Let me revise the list of remaining activities that haven't been migrated to iOS yet:

1. **Vehicle List Activity**
   - Manages vehicle information including:
     - Vehicle details (VIN, plate)
     - Employee assignments
     - Odometer readings
     - Vehicle maintenance notes
     - Vehicle status tracking

2. **AST (Above Storage Tank) Activity**
   - Manages above storage tank inspections
   - Tracks tank conditions and measurements
   - Records compliance information

3. **Expenses Activity**
   - Handles expense tracking and reporting
   - Manages expense categories and records
   - Tracks receipts and reimbursements

4. **Status Activity**
   - Shows system status information including:
     - Database statistics
     - Record counts for different activities
     - Storage usage
     - Notification counts
     - System health metrics

Would you like me to start implementing any of these remaining activities? I can begin with whichever one you consider the highest priority.

Let me know which one you'd like me to work on first, and I'll create the corresponding models, view models, and views in the iOS app while maintaining feature parity with Android and following iOS design patterns.

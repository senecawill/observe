# Seneca Meter Implementation Summary

## Project Structure
I've implemented a Flask-based web application for the Seneca Meter system with the following components:

### Application Architecture
- **Flask Framework**: The application is built using the Flask web framework with various extensions
- **SQLAlchemy ORM**: For database interactions with the MySQL schema
- **Flask-Login**: For user authentication and session management
- **Jinja2 Templates**: For HTML rendering with Bootstrap 5 styling
- **RESTful API Endpoints**: For fetching data for charts and reports

### Core Components

1. **Models**
   - Database models mapped to the provided MySQL schema
   - Includes User, Customer, Device, Event, EventData, Role, and UserRole models
   - Relationships defined between models for efficient queries

2. **Routes/Controllers**
   - Dashboard: Main overview with KPIs and device summary
   - Devices: Device listing and detailed device view with charts
   - Reports: Production, pressure, and custom reporting
   - Admin: User, customer, and device management
   - Authentication: Login and password reset

3. **Templates**
   - Responsive UI using Bootstrap 5
   - Interactive charts using Chart.js
   - Modular design with base template inheritance
   - Form templates for data management

4. **Static Assets**
   - Custom CSS for styling
   - JavaScript for enhanced interactivity
   - Font Awesome for icons

## Key Features Implemented

### Dashboard
- KPI cards showing total MCFD, BPD, average pressure, and active device count
- Interactive chart displaying device performance metrics
- Alerts and notifications panel
- Device summary table with status indicators

### Device Management
- Device listing with filtering and sorting
- Detailed device view with:
  - Basic information and status
  - Latest readings
  - Interactive charts for historical data
  - Data analysis with metrics summary
  - Historical data table
  - Export functionality

### Reporting
- Production reports with MCFD data
- Pressure analysis reports
- Custom report builder
- Various time period selections
- Export options (CSV, Excel, PDF)

### Administration
- User management (create, edit, delete)
- Customer management (create, edit, delete)
- Device configuration
- Role-based access control

### Authentication & Security
- Secure login with password hashing
- Role-based permissions
- Password reset functionality

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 5
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
- **Database**: MySQL (as per the provided schema)
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login, Bcrypt

## Installation & Setup
1. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
2. Configure database connection in .env file
3. Run database migrations
4. Start the Flask development server

## Next Steps
- Add unit and integration tests
- Implement user profile management
- Add more advanced reporting features
- Implement real-time data updates
- Add API documentation
- Deploy to production environment

The application follows best practices for Flask development, including:
- Separation of concerns with blueprints
- Model-View-Controller pattern
- Environment-based configuration
- Secure authentication
- Responsive UI design

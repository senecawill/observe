Below is a **high-level overview** of the U.S. (FCC) regulations for **duty cycle** and **power limits** in the 902–928 MHz ISM band, where LoRa typically operates. LoRa is governed primarily by **FCC Part 15**—specifically **Part 15.247** for spread spectrum and digital modulation systems.

## 1. Duty Cycle in the USA

**Unlike the European Union, the USA does not impose a strict duty cycle limit** (e.g., no “1% duty cycle” requirement) in the 902–928 MHz ISM band.  
Instead, the FCC rules rely on limits to **transmit power**, **occupied bandwidth**, and **dwell time** for frequency-hopping systems to reduce interference.

- **No explicit duty cycle constraint:** Devices can transmit as often as they like, subject to the power and bandwidth/dwell time constraints below.
- **Dwell time** (for frequency-hopping systems): Must not exceed **400 ms** on any given frequency within a **20-second** period if you are classified as a frequency-hopping spread spectrum system.

## 2. Power Limits in the USA

### 2.1 General LoRa (Spread Spectrum) Rules Under Part 15.247

LoRa is considered a form of spread-spectrum or digital modulation. The main limits you encounter are:

1. **Conducted Power:** Up to **1 watt** (30 dBm) into the antenna.
2. **Peak EIRP (Effective Isotropic Radiated Power):**
    - Typically up to **36 dBm** if your antenna gain is **6 dBi** or less.
    - If you use an antenna with gain higher than 6 dBi, you must reduce your transmitter output power so that total EIRP does not exceed 36 dBm (or meet other specific conditions in Part 15.247(e)).
3. **Power Spectral Density (PSD) limits:**
    - For digitally modulated systems (including certain LoRa modes) with bandwidth ≥ 500 kHz, the max power spectral density is typically **8 dBm/3 kHz**.
    - If you’re below 500 kHz bandwidth, different limits or frequency-hopping rules will apply.

### 2.2 Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) Option

If your LoRa device implements a true frequency-hopping scheme across at least 50 channels (with each channel spacing ≥ 25 kHz), you can also comply under the FHSS rules:

- **Max Conducted Power:** 1 Watt (30 dBm).
- **Dwell Time:** ≤ 400 ms in any 20-second period per channel.

### 2.3 Examples for Practical LoRa Devices

- A typical commercial LoRa module (e.g., 125 kHz bandwidth, single-channel) can comply with **digital-modulation** rules if it meets the PSD limit and the total conducted power limit. Some vendors pre-certify modules so you only need a simple certification filing or use them in a certified end product.
- Some devices use a **lower power** (e.g., 14–20 dBm) by default to avoid complexities with higher-gain antennas or PSD compliance.

## 3. Summary of U.S. Considerations

4. **No strict duty cycle limit** (like the EU). You can transmit continuously if you adhere to power/PSD/dwell-time constraints.
5. **Max 1 W (30 dBm) conducted power** into the antenna; up to **36 dBm EIRP** is allowed if antenna gain ≤ 6 dBi.
6. **Frequency hopping** (≥ 50 channels) must keep dwell time ≤ 400 ms per channel in a 20-second window.
7. **If not hopping**, your LoRa device must comply with digital modulation/PSD rules (8 dBm/3 kHz), which often means adjusting output power or bandwidth.
8. Always ensure your **final product certification** aligns with FCC Part 15.247 or consult your module’s certification to see if you can piggyback on the module’s existing FCC ID.

By staying within these power and bandwidth rules, you can transmit LoRa signals in the 915 MHz band in the U.S. without a specific duty cycle restriction—unlike in many other regions where duty cycle or “listen-before-talk” rules may apply.

# **SenecaGIS vs WVDEP and National Brokers: The Most Accurate GIS for Oil & Gas Data Management**  

**SenecaGIS** is a **web-based Geographic Information System (GIS)** tailored for the **oil and gas industry**, providing **unmatched access to well, land, and production data**. Developed by **Seneca Technologies**, SenecaGIS empowers **mineral buyers, landmen, operators, engineers, and geologists** to streamline workflows, evaluate assets, and make **faster, data-driven decisions**.

When it comes to well location data, many **national data brokers** rely on **West Virginia DEP (WVDEP) records** as their primary source. However, a **comparative accuracy study** conducted by **WVDEP’s own Technical Applications and GIS Unit** found that **WVDEP well locations are often highly inaccurate—sometimes off by over a mile**. Because **national data providers pull directly from WVDEP without additional verification**, their datasets contain **significant errors**, leading to **costly mistakes for mineral buyers, landmen, and operators**.

## **A Legacy of Accuracy: The OGIS Data Advantage**  

In **2008, Seneca Technologies acquired Oil and Gas Information Service (OGIS)** and digitized its **extensive collection of historical paper maps**, forming the foundation of **SenecaGIS**. This effort preserved **decades of well records, lease maps, and production history**, integrating them into **a modern GIS platform that far surpasses standard state databases**.  

Additionally, **SenecaGIS includes over 25,000 pre-permit well records missing from the West Virginia DEP database**. These records came from **OGIS original paper records** that are not part of the WVDEP database, making **SenecaGIS the most complete and accurate oil and gas well database in the region**.  

### **SenecaGIS vs. WVDEP: Well Location Accuracy Study**

A comparative study conducted by the West Virginia DEP’s own Technical Applications and GIS Unit ([Kanawha State Forest Accuracy Study](https://tagis.dep.wv.gov/tagis/projects/OG_well_accuracy-kanawha_state_forest.pdf))** examined well locations for discrepancies between **SenecaGIS OGIS well locations** and the **West Virginia DEP’s Oil and Gas Well Database**.

| Accuracy Metric        | **SenecaGIS OGIS** | **WVDEP**  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- |
| **RMSE Error**         | 186 feet           | 4,448 feet |
| **Accuracy (95%)**     | 321 feet           | 7,699 feet |
| **Standard Deviation** | 112 feet           | 4,166 feet |
Well location errors relative to GPS locations (in feet), as documented in the Kanawha State Forest Accuracy Study.

### **Key Takeaways from the Accuracy Study**

- **SenecaGIS (OGIS) well locations demonstrated significantly higher accuracy** compared to WVDEP’s database
- **WVDEP well coordinates contained frequent inaccuracies**, with some wells displaced by **more than a mile** from their true GPS location.
- **WVDEP well location errors are not unique to Kanawha State Forest**. Many **DEP well coordinates are incorrect statewide**, with errors found **in multiple counties**, affecting **title research, lease accuracy, and drilling operations** across West Virginia.
- **Historical reporting errors in WVDEP data persist today**, making **accurate well mapping critical for mineral buyers, landmen, and operators**.
- **National data brokers relying on WVDEP well locations unknowingly distribute these inaccuracies** to their customers.

## **Why This Matters for Mineral Buyers, Landmen & Operators**  
For **mineral buyers and land professionals**, missing or inaccurate well data can mean **miscalculating asset values, overlooking key production history, or purchasing interests that have already been drained**.  

For **operators and engineers**, drilling in an area with **unknown legacy wells can lead to regulatory violations, unexpected pressure zones, or spacing conflicts** that delay projects and increase costs.  

- **Mineral Buyers & Investors** – **Avoid overpaying for acreage with existing leases** by verifying historical well locations and production records.  
- **Landmen & Title Researchers** – **Confirm well placements, ownership history, and leasehold status** before finalizing transactions.  
- **Operators & Engineers** – **Ensure accurate well spacing and avoid costly errors** by relying on **real, verified well locations** rather than incomplete state records.  

## **The High Cost of Inaccurate Well Locations**  

Relying on **incomplete or incorrect well data** can lead to **significant financial and operational risks**:  
- **Safety & Environmental Hazards** – **Undocumented offset wells** increase the risk of **gas migration, loss of circulation, or well blowouts** near new drilling sites.  
- **Legal Disputes & Liabilities** – Poor well data can **cause boundary disputes, lease conflicts, and litigation** over royalties or unit allocations.
